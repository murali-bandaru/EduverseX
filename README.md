## 🧠 About the Project

### Inspiration
As students, we often struggle to find reliable and updated information about learning opportunities. Searching multiple platforms for courses, internships, or hackathons can be time-consuming and confusing.  
EduVerseX was created to **simplify this journey** — giving students a single digital hub to discover everything academic and career-related.

### What We Built
We developed a **Flask-based web application** that integrates multiple CSV-based data modules, including:
- 📘 **Courses** from different learning platforms  
- 💼 **Internships** from verified companies  
- 🧩 **Open-source Projects** to contribute and learn  
- 🎯 **Hackathons** and innovation challenges  
- 🎓 **Scholarships** for financial assistance  
- 🏫 **Top Indian Institutions** with program details  
- 📰 **Blogs & FAQs** for student learning and awareness  

All data is rendered dynamically using Flask, Pandas, and Jinja2 templates.

### How We Built It
We used:
- **Flask (Python)** for backend logic and routing  
- **Pandas** to handle structured data from CSVs  
- **Matplotlib** for analytics and graphs  
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for frontend  
- **Jinja2** for templating dynamic web pages  

Each module (courses, internships, blogs, etc.) is separated into its own CSV file, keeping the structure clean, modular, and scalable.

### Challenges We Faced
- Integrating multiple CSV datasets without performance lag  
- Maintaining UI consistency across multiple pages  
- Ensuring the app remains visually engaging yet lightweight  
- Handling route-level logic without breaking the template hierarchy  

### What We Learned
- Better understanding of Flask routing and templating  
- Data manipulation and integration using Pandas  
- Frontend design using pure CSS without external libraries  
- Structuring a full-fledged student-focused web application
